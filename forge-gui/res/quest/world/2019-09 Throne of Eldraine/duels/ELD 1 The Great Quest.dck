Title=The Great Quest
Difficulty=easy
Description=About once a generation, a mysterious creature called the Questing Beast chooses an extraordinary knight to undertake a grueling challenge, called the Great Quest, to claim the High Throne of the realm. Those seeking the High Throne must achieve knighthood from all five of the realm's royal courts, proving they are virtuous enough to be worthy of the loftiest position in the realm. In the last fifty years, two individuals have been charged with the High Quest: the current High King Kenrith and his wife, Queen Linden of Ardenvale.
